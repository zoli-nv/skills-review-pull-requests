## Step 4: Suggest changes

_Nice work reviewing that pull request :sparkles:_

While reviewing, it is very common to find simple changes that are easier to implement than to describe. For example, typos or rewording sentences. These are perfect situations for the **Add a suggestion** feature.

### How do I suggest a change?

The **Add a suggestion** feature is a button in the comment text editor. It inserts a specially formatted code block. Instead of only showing a comment, GitHub will also provide a **Commit changes** button. This allows the author to accept the suggestion and commit it with the push of a button. No need to open a code editor! Nice!
